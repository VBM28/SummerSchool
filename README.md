# SummerSchool

1.	Write a method that receives an integer as parameter and prints the binary representation of it.
2.	Write a method that receives a string and checks if it is a palindrome or not.
3.	Write a method to count all words in a string.
4.	Write a method to return the average of three numbers.
5.	Write a program to multiply two given integers without using the multiply operator(*).
6.	Write a program to accept two string and test if the second string contains the first one.
7.	Create a method that converts a given number of kilograms to pounds(lbs).
8.	Write 2 programs to check if 2 strings are equal or not. Hint: == and .equals()
9.	Write a program that takes input from the keyboard and prints each character on a new line. The empty spaces will be excluded from the print.
      Ex: “1 2 3 a b”
      =>
      1
      2
      3
      a
      b

10.	Password complexity: Write a method that checks the complexity of the password it receives as input.
       Ex: Has at least 8 characters, has numbers and letters, etc.

11.	Change the way you call the method we wrote earlier so that it validates the user input instead of a String we declare.

12.	Write a program that will accept an integer and convert it into a binary representation. Now count the number of bits which is equal to zero of the said binary representation.

13.	Write a Java program to reverse the content of a sentence (assume a single space between two words) without reverse every word.

14.	Write a method that receives 2 parameters, a string and a Boolean. Based of the value of the Boolean, return the string all in upper case or lower case.

15.	Create a method that receives a string as a parameter and returns the number of characters from it. Overload that method such that it receives a string and an integer and returns true if the number of characters from the string is equal to the integer.

16.	Print the current time. After doing so, format the current time in a date time format.

17.	Write a program to find the Fibonacci number using recursion.
18.	Write a program that receives a String and prints 3 lists. The 1st list will contain all the even numbers, the 2nd one all the odd numbers and the 3rd one will print all the other characters. In case a list is empty it will not be printed.
       Ex: “ab1298cd”
       1st list: 28
       2nd list: 19
       3rd list: abcd
19.	Write a method that receives an integer as parameter and returns “FIZZ” if the number is a multiple of 3, “BUZZ” if it is a multiple of 5, “FIZZBUZZ” if it’s a multiple of both 3 and 5 and “NON” otherwise.

20.	Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

## Text Game ##

Create a text game.
…
That’s it.

A few bullet points that you should follow:
- Start by creating your game logic (what the game is about, what are the mechanics of the game, in what way will the user interact with the code)
- Create a “design” for your classes such as the classes that hold the data about the characters, how the classes interact with each other(like inheritance, polymorphism, etc)

##Example of game:

RPG Text game in which the user has to select the character’s name and the weapon.
The game uses the Scanner class to take user input and a random generator for different things such as the no. of waves, the no. of health potions, etc.
You can find the game logic here https://github.com/VBM28/rpg-text-game-v2/blob/master/README.md

_NOTE_: Although you can use the same logic to develop your game, I HIGHLY recommend to try this on your own without checking the code. This is purely a fun activity to develop your analytical skills and to have a better understanding of converting the logic to code.
